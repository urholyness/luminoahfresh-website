## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Solution**: Wait 1-24 hours, verify DNS records are correct
**Test**: Use dnschecker.org to monitor propagation

#### Website redirects to old content
**Cause**: Browser/DNS caching
**Solutions**: 
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Try incognito/private browsing
- Test different browsers
- Clear browser cache

#### GitHub URL redirects unexpectedly
**Cause**: CNAME file causing premature redirects
**Solution**: Temporarily remove CNAME content, test direct GitHub URL, restore after DNS propagation

#### Images not loading
**Causes**: Incorrect file paths, missing uploads
**Solutions**:
- Verify file names match HTML references exactly
